    "# Question 4: History and Defenses\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding oracle that you've developed in this lab has been used in plenty of real-world attacks. The attack was first discovered (publicly) in 2002. Since 2002 is well within the era of the internet, you can find the paper published by the exploit's original authors [here](https://www.iacr.org/cryptodb/archive/2002/EUROCRYPT/2850/2850.pdf). Exploits were quickly engineered against all sorts of servers to great success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fixes for this original attack \"fixed\" the vulnerability by simply stopping the server from directly telling users whether a message was padded correctly or not. But later attacks, in particular [lucky thirteen](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/02/lucky-thirteen-attack-snarfs-cookies-protected-by-ssl-encryption/), utilized the fact that a *timing* side-channel could let an attacker statistically infer when a padding was set correctly even without the server telling them explicitly. This illustrates how hard it is to avoid side-channel attacks and why we always prefer to use schemes which fail as safely as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most part, CBC padding oracle attacks have been patched, but there are notable circumstances in which they can still be used to great success. [Some attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POODLE) use the fact that users can request to use older versions of protocols for backwards compatibilty, which can directly enable old attacks to come back to life. And since implementing cryptography is *hard*, patches and fixes can result in the resurrection of previously-patched vulnerabilities. Check out [this](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2016-2107) CVE, an ironic example of how a patch for lucky thirteen actually *enabled* a padding oracle attack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore a possible defense. Sending just a message encrypted with CBC mode guarantees us confidentiality if we use a secure block cipher, which we generally assume AES is. The lack of authentication and integrity checking mean that we as attackers are allowed to freely tamper with messages in order to decrypt them. It stands to reason that added some authentication and integrity checks would prevent us from successfully modifying messages for the server's examination. For simplicity, let's consider just two possible methods of achieving this: MAC-then-encrypt and encrypt-then-MAC, both with a secure MAC algorithm."

In this question, we'll walk you through how the SHA-2 algorithm actually works and show you how an attacker could use that knowledge to forge SHA-2 hashes based on (message, hash) pairs that they observe. As with the CBC padding oracle part of this lab, we highly recommend that you complete HW2 before attempting this question in order to gain some intuition.\n",

    "The notorious hacker Vladimir Computin has hacked into Commerica's *Department of Voting Machine Software* in order to corrupt Commerica's upcoming election by modifying the *Department*'s star product, VoteOS. In particular, Computin has discovered a buffer overflow vulnerability in VoteOS that circumvents stack canaries and ASLR, but he wants to also defeat NX bit protection. He intends to do this by distributing a version of VoteOS which contains his shellcode in the binary itself. The only problem is that VoteOS is distributed along with the signature $\\mathrm{SHA}(k||B)$ where $k$ is a secret key that all government officials memorize and $B$ is the VoteOS binary. Computin controls an empire of USB flash drive distributors, but he is somehow unable to discover $k$. Stymied, Computin calls you, his trusty CS 161 friend and former KGB colleague, to help circumvent this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know the gist of SHA-2 length extension attacks, so you tell Computin that it'll be no problem. Since you know the hash of the original binary and are only adding code to the end of the file, you code up a way to spoof the new binary's SHA-256 hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you realize that since SHA-256 pads its inputs before performing any computations, you can't actually directly extend $\\mathrm{SHA}(k||B)$ to $\\mathrm{SHA}(k||B||M)$ (where $M$ is Computin's malcode). Consulting your reference implementation of SHA-256, you realize that you'll only be able to construct the hash $\\mathrm{SHA}(k||B||p||M)$ where $p$ is the padding generated by the SHA-256 algorithm. This, however, is no problem &mdash; Computin's attacks will work just as well on the binary $B||p||M$ as they would on $B||M$ (why? Remeber that the message itself is a binary, and think about the structure of assembly programs).\n",
